# React Portfolio

A place to share projects with potential employers as well as other developers.

## Goal:

Create a portfolio using your new React skills, which will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios donâ€™t use the latest technologies.

## Issues:

- Package.json issues took up time and forced me to re-create multiple repos.
- Links not set up correctly at this time.
- I tried multiple times to like to react-bootstrap in order to give it a more dynamic feel; however it made my app very messy so I again reverted back to a simplier working version.
- I did install gh-pages in order to deploy properly, however when I went to test it earlier on in the design process it did not seem to be working correctly.

## Results:

I was able to successfully built a react app using npx create-react-app. I was able to create some styling and create a template to fine tune in the future.
